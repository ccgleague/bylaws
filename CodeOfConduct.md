# Code of Conduct

All members must abide by the code of conduct when playing in CCGL events, interacting with other members in any league capacity, or representing the league in any fashion on any medium, including but not limited to social media (both publicly and privately visible), print, television, and radio. 

### We Don't Tolerate Harrassment

The CCGL is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or quality of play. We do not tolerate harassment of members in any form. Members violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the league at the sole discretion of the league officers.

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, quality of play, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, intentional disruption of play, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

### Courtsey Is Expected

Members are expected to be courteous to other members, golf course staff, and other players on the course. This includes: 
  * Ensuring the safety of other golfers on the course
  * Maintaining a reasonable pace of play
  * Repairing divots and ball marks
  * Avoiding damage to the course (especially the greens and tee boxes)
  * Raking bunkers smooth after hitting out of them
  * Avoiding players’ path of play (especially on greens)
  * Being quiet when other players are hitting
  
Members asked to stop any unacceptable behavior are expected to comply immediately. Members who witness violations of this code of conduct are expected to report those violations to a league officer as soon as possible.

### Play By The Rules

All members are expected to play in CCGL events by the strict rules of golf, in particular this means:

  * No mulligans
  * No gimmies
  * Play the ball as it lies

The rules are confusing enough, without making vague exceptions some of the time. We think that taking fewer strokes (due to the stroke limits of the Chicago format) and making each one of them count is just a faster, better, more fun way to play golf, rather than taking a “gimme” for a quadruple bogey when you’re 3 feet from the hole. Each member of a team acts as a marker for the other person and reports their score, not their own score. It’s the responsibility of every league member to report the correct score for their teammate.

If there is a question or disagreement about the rules, [get the app](https://www.usga.org/content/usga/home-page/rules-hub/rules-of-golf-apps.html)! Or ask Google. If you can’t find an answer that way, do what makes sense and let ask an officer after the round is over. Posted scores may be adjusted to take into account the correct rules.

### Welcome New Members

It is the responsibility of every existing member of the CCGL to do their best to create a fun and welcoming environment for new members. As such, giving unsolicited golf advice during a round will be treated as harassment. As experienced golfers know, thinking about the technical aspects of your swing while trying to play on the course is a recipe for disaster. Inflicting advice on a golfer who already has a thousand thoughts running through their head will ruin their day and lower your team point total. Always be sure advice is requested and welcome before giving it, and be conservative about giving advice about golf technique in the middle of a round.
